    Head straight into the forest
  </h1>
  <p class = "prettycolors">
    You decide to search for water and possibly stay away from the megalodon who
    shoots freakin laser beams attached to its freakin head. You grab your ak74u for protection.
     The forest looks dense and hilly. You count your rounds and find you are only carrying
     200 rounds, you must use them sparingly. So you head straight into the forest.
     You just run into thick vegetation. When suddenly a giant griffon lands right
     next to you. He is within range to see you but hasn't yet.
