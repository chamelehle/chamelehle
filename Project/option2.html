    Head straight into the forest
  </h1>
  <p class = "prettycolors">
     You grab your ak74u for protection real quick and run into the forest.
     The forest looks dense and hilly. Once inside the forest you count your rounds
     and find you are only carrying 200 rounds, you must use them sparingly.
     You are going through the thick vegetation when suddenly a giant griffon lands right
     next to you. He is within range to see you but hasn't yet.
