    You unload your entire 30 round clip into the griffon. The bullet seem to be
     deflecting off it's hide. But luckily this was enough to make the griffon
     shout and fly away. Crisis averted. While standing there, you then realize
     you hear running water. You excitedly run towards the source of the noise
     and find a giant deep pond that is fed by a watefall. It has a nice flat
     area that would be good for a camp. But it is getting dark and need to think
      about shelter for the night.
