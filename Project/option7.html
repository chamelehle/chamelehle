    Duck down quietly

    You duck down and wait very quietly. Hello kitty knows how to stealth from her
    service in Vietnam. The griffon sniffs a bush, grabs at some berries and then
    flies away. While kneeling there, you realize you hear running water.
    You excitedly run towards the source of the noise
    and find a giant deep pond that is fed by a watefall. It has a nice flat
    area that would be good for a camp. But it is getting dark and need to think
     about shelter for the night.
