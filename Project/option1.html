    Follow Beach
  </h1>
  <p class = "prettycolors">
    You decide to follow the beach and get a hold on what you are dealing with.
     Except you will not walk this beach like a mere peasant would! You are hello
     kitty. So you stroll over to your boat and take out a dirtbike and an ak74u, just
     in case laser beam megalodon comes after you again. So you set off on the
     beach and soon realize you have spent more than half your gas going around
     this island. The island seems rather large and you've only encountered more
      dense forest and hills inland.
