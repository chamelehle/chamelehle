    Entrance of rock cave

  You sleep at the entrance of the cave. At around 4 a.m. a motherbear comes back
   to her cave and thinks you are one of her young. So she picks you up and carries
   you further into the cave. You play along trying not to upset the bear. But once
   you get back to her cubs they eat you.
