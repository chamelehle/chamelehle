    Battle charging into the forest
  </h1>
  <p class = "prettycolors">
    You sprint towards the forest while firing randomly into the lush vegetation.
    You get about 100 yrds into the forest when you get ambushed by 3 flying unicorns
    with missile launchers on their backs. Luckily for you they didn't calibrate their
    sights correctly and couldn't fire the rockets accurately. You switch to automatic
    on your ak and return fire. You hit one of them in the knee(now he's a gaurd in skyrim)
    and he falls out of the sky. The other two retreat out of sight and the forest is on fire.</p>
